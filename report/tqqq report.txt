比较单日内tqqq是不是真的qqq的三倍波动
波动过小的时候，还会涨跌不一致


长期持有
遇到暴跌,会出现qqq还是盈利的。但是tqqq已经把之前的盈利吐出来的情况
tqqq需要一定程度的止盈和择时 还有地位加仓。 否则遇到暴跌，会出现浪费等待时间加的情况
高位止盈。底位加仓


长期持有,杠杆率的平均值是3.163
这就让我注意到一个之前没有在意的重要细节：

qqq 
    2012/08 58 
    2022/08 313
    大约10年6倍


tqqq:
    2012/08 1 
    2022/08 37.98
    大约37倍

37/6 = 6.16667
也就是说tqqq的惊人数据也是因为qqq的出色表现导致的
长牛会让tqqq的杠杆系数变大

真的有钱人买入qqq spy schd是最舒服的了
所以说真正的投资是一件很无聊的事情
